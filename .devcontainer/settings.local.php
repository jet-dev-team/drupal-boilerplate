 * site is deployed on a cluster of web servers, you must ensure that this
 * variable has the same value on each server.
 *
 * For enhanced security, you may set this variable to the contents of a file
 * outside your document root, and vary the value across environments (like
 * production and development); you should also ensure that this file is not
 * stored with backups of your database.

 * Example:
 * @code

 * @endcode

/**
 * Trusted host configuration.
 *
 * Drupal core can use the Symfony trusted host mechanism to prevent HTTP Host
 * header spoofing.
 *
 * To enable the trusted host mechanism, you enable your allowable hosts
 * in $settings['trusted_host_patterns']. This should be an array of regular
 * expression patterns, without delimiters, representing the hosts you would
 * like to allow.
 *
 * For example:
 * @code
 * $settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = [
 *   '^www\.example\.com$',
 * ];
 * @endcode
 * will allow the site to only run from www.example.com.
 *
 * If you are running multisite, or if you are running your site from
 * different domain names (eg, you don't redirect http://www.example.com to
 * http://example.com), you should specify all of the host patterns that are
 * allowed by your site.
 *
 * For example:
 * @code
 * $settings['trusted_host_patterns'] = [
 *   '^example\.com$',
 *   '^.+\.example\.com$',
 *   '^example\.org$',
 *   '^.+\.example\.org$',
 * ];
 * @endcode
 * will allow the site to run off of all variants of example.com and
 * example.org, with all subdomains included.
 *
 * @see https://www.drupal.org/docs/installing-drupal/trusted-host-settings
